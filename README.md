## Built on

- Strapi
- Gatsby

## Development

First get /priest-cms running this is hosted on Linode.
Theres a difference between npm start and npm run develop. Start let's you work, develop lets you edit.

`npm run develop`

Once strapi is running get gatsby running.

`npm start`

### Markdown Images

I'm not sure if this is how I will do it forever but I'm importing into strapi but also running the live image from aws.
